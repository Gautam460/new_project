Coding Test: Integration with ValueSERP API and CSV Export Functionality
Objective: Create a PHP application that integrates with the ValueSERP API, processes search results, and allows users to download these results in CSV format.


Requirements:

1. API Signup and Setup:
   - Sign up for a free account at [ValueSERP] (https://www.valueserp.com/) to obtain an API key.
   - Set up a basic PHP environment to develop the application.

2. Core Functionality:
   - Create a simple PHP application with a user-friendly interface.
   - Users should be able to input multiple search queries (4-5).
   - The application should query the ValueSERP API for each input and retrieve the search results.

3. Data Processing and Display:
●	Process the JSON responses to extract relevant data (e.g., titles, links, snippets).
●	Store the results in a structured format suitable for CSV conversion.

4. CSV Export Feature:

●	Implement a feature allowing users to export the aggregated search results of all queries into a CSV file.
●	Ensure the CSV file is formatted correctly with appropriate headers and data rows.


4. Error Handling and Validation:
   - Implement error handling for scenarios like invalid input, API failures, or no results found.
   - Validate user input to ensure it is appropriate for a search query.


Submission Instructions:
- The candidate should host their code on a platform like GitHub or Bitbucket.
- Provide instructions on setting up and running the application.	
- Submit the link to the repository along with any necessary setup instructions.
